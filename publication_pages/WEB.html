    <!-- <h2>A simple shape for a functional FSI benchmark</h2> -->
    <p> Intrasaccular flow disruptors such as the Woven EndoBridge (WEB) device are effective treatments for wide-necked
      intracranial aneurysms, but challenges remain in device sizing and deployment prediction. We are developing a
      high-fidelity computational framework for geometrical modeling, virtual deployment, and hemodynamic assessment of
      the WEB using patient-specific data. A parametrized WEB model is constructed and validated against microscopy
      images of physical samples, and a diffusion-based deployment method is introduced to simulate the device’s gradual
      expansion within the aneurysm. The resulting deployed geometry is embedded into patient-specific vascular meshes
      to enable high-resolution computational fluid dynamics simulations. Validation across multiple clinical cases
      shows consistent reductions in intra-aneurysmal velocity, wall shear stress, and inflow, indicating effective flow
      disruption. This approach provides an end-to-end framework for improving WEB deployment planning and evaluating
      treatment performance through realistic computational simulations.
