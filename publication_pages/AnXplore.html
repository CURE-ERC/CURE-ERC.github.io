      <h1>AnXplore, a dataset of 101 semi-idealized sidewall aneurysms</h1>

      <p>Computational fluid dynamics is intensively used to deepen the understanding of aneurysm growth and rupture in the attempt to support physicians during therapy planning.
        Numerous studies have assumed fully-rigid vessel walls in their simulations, whose sole hemodynamics may fail to provide a satisfactory criterion for rupture risk assessment.
        Moreover, direct in-vivo observations of intracranial aneurysm pulsation have been recently reported, encouraging the development of fluid-structure interaction for their modelling and for new assessments.
        In this work, we describe a new fluid-structure interaction benchmark setting for the careful evaluation of different aneurysm shapes.
        The studied configurations consist of three real aneurysm domes positioned on a toroidal channel.
        All geometric features, meshing characteristics, flow quantities, comparisons with a rigid-wall model and corresponding plots are provided.
        Reported results emphasize the alteration of flow patterns and hemodynamic descriptors when moving from the rigid-wall model to the complete fluid-structure interaction framework, thereby underlining the importance of the coupling between hemodynamics and the surrounding vessel tissue.
