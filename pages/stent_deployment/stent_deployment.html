      <h1>Virtual flow diverter deployment and embedding for haemodynamic simulations</h1>
      <p>
        Flow-diverter stents offer clinicians an effective solution for treating intracranial aneurysms, especially in cases where other
        devices may be unsuitable. However, strongly deviating success rates among different centers, manufacturers, and aneurysm
        phenotypes highlight the need for better in-situ studies of these devices. To support research in this area, virtual stenting
        algorithms have been proposed that, combined with computational fluid dynamics, provide insights into the haemodynamic
        alterations induced by the device. Yet, many existing algorithms rely on uncertain parameters, such as the forces applied
        during operation, fail to predict the length of the device after deployment, or lack robust validation steps, raising concerns
        about their reliability. Therefore, we developed a robust deployment technique that builds upon the geometrical features of the
        vessel and includes advancements from previous works. The algorithm is detailed and validated against literature examples,
        in-vitro experiments, and patient data, achieving a mean angular error below 5â—¦ in the latter. Furthermore, we showed how the
        deployed device can be embedded in a computational mesh using open-source tools and anisotropic meshing routines.
