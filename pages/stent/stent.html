      <h1>Reinforcement learning for patient-specific optimal stenting of intracranial aneurysms</h1>
      <p>
        Developing new capabilities to predict the risk of intracranial aneurysm rupture and to improve
        treatment outcomes in the follow‑up of endovascular repair is of tremendous medical and societal
        interest, both to support decision‑making and assessment of treatment options by medical doctors,
        and to improve the life quality and expectancy of patients. This study aims at identifying and
        characterizing novel flow‑deviator stent devices through a high‑fidelity computational framework
        that combines state‑of‑the‑art numerical methods to accurately describe the mechanical exchanges
        between the blood flow, the aneurysm, and the flow‑deviator and deep reinforcement learning
        algorithms to identify a new stent concepts enabling patient‑specific treatment via accurate
        adjustment of the functional parameters in the implanted state.
